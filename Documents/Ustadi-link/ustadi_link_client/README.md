## ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI Curriculum Builder:** Our core innovation. Artisans can simply record audio of themselves explaining a task in their natural language (English or Swahili). Our AI backend, powered by OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-4o, automatically transcribes and structures this audio into a complete, easy-to-read "Skill Module."
* **Hyper-Local Artisan Discovery:** A clean, responsive interface for learners to discover and connect with vetted artisans in their community, with options to filter by skill and location.
* **Multi-Page Architecture:** A full-stack application built with a modern React frontend and a robust Node.js backend, featuring seamless navigation with React Router.
